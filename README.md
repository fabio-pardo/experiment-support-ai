# Support AI Agent with Multimedia Support
## 🛠️ MVP Scope & Flow

1. Input: A support engineer asks the agent a troubleshooting question.
- Example: “How do I restart the container service if it fails after deployment?”

2. Processing:
- Search runbooks (structured text).
- Search video transcripts (auto-generated subtitles).
- Search diagrams/FAQs (converted to text via OCR if needed).

3. Output:
The agent returns:
  - A summary answer synthesized from the best sources.
  - Linked snippets pointing to:
    - Relevant runbook section
    - Video clip (with timestamp)
    - Diagram or doc reference

Example output:

“You can restart the container service by running systemctl restart containerd. [Runbook, Section 3.2]

## 🧩 Key MVP Features

- Multi-modal retrieval (text, video, doc).
- Snippet + context highlighting (so users trust the answer).
- Video time-jump links (wow factor).
- Unified interface (single chat or web UI).

## 🚀 How to Build the MVP

- Backend:
  - Store runbooks & transcripts in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS).
  - Use embeddings to make them searchable.
  - For videos, pre-process transcripts and attach timestamps.

- Frontend:
  - Simple web UI or chatbot where a user types a question.
  - Show results grouped by media type.

- Demo dataset:
  - Take 2–3 runbooks (text).
  - 1–2 knowledge transfer videos (with transcript).
  - 1 troubleshooting diagram or FAQ doc.
  - Keep it small but realistic.

## 🌟 Stretch Goals (if time allows)

- Natural language to procedure execution (e.g., agent suggests a command to run).
- Confidence scores for retrieved answers.
- Feedback loop (thumbs up/down to refine retrieval).
