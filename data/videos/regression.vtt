Welcome to Introduction to Regression.

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.239
After watching this video, you will be able to

3
00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.680
Define regression, Compare simple and multiple regression

4
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.559
Explain applications of regression

5
00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:20.920
Regression is a type of supervised learning model.

6
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.639
It models a relationship between a continuous
target variable and explanatory features.

7
00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:29.559
Consider this dataset related to CO2 emissions from different cars.

8
00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:34.599
The features in this dataset include engine size,
number of cylinders, fuel consumption,

9
00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:37.840
and CO2 emissions from various automobile models.

10
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.759
Given this dataset, is it possible to predict the
CO2 emission of a new car from the listed

11
00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:43.759
features?

12
00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:45.459
The answer is yes.

13
00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:49.040
Using potentially predictive features,
you can use regression to predict a continuous

14
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.880
value, such as CO2 emissions.

15
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.479
Let's consider the previous dataset
comprising some features in past cars.

16
00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:00.360
Then, from that data, a model can be
trained to estimate the CO2 emissions of each car.

17
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.279
Let's use regression to build such a predictive model.

18
00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:09.199
Then, the model is used to predict the
expected CO2 emission for a new or hypothetical car.

19
00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:10.760
There are several types of regression.

20
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.199
Deciding which one to use depends on the
data you have for the dependent variable and the

21
00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:16.440
type of model that provides the best fit.

22
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.760
In this video, we'll discuss the following
two types of regression models, simple regression

23
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.599
and multiple regression.

24
00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:26.919
Simple regression is when a single independent
variable estimates a dependent variable.

25
00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:29.360
Simple regression can be linear or nonlinear.

26
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.559
For example, predicting CO2 emission using
the variable engine size.

27
00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:37.800
Simple linear regression imposes a linear
relationship between the dependent and independent

28
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.800
variables.

29
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.639
Similarly, nonlinear regression creates a
nonlinear relationship between those variables.

30
00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:48.680
When more than one independent variable is present,
the process is called multiple regression.

31
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.879
The distinctions between linear and nonlinear
relationships apply to simple and multiple

32
00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:53.879
regression.

33
00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:57.879
For example, predicting CO2 emission using
engine size and the number of cylinders in

34
00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:59.160
any given car.

35
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.480
Again, depending on the relation between
dependent and independent variables, it can be either

36
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.800
linear or nonlinear regression.

37
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.759
Let's examine some sample applications of regression.

38
00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.479
Essentially, we use regression when we want
to estimate a continuous value.

39
00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:18.399
For instance, one of the applications of
regression analysis could be in the area of sales forecasting.

40
00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:21.759
You can predict a salesperson's yearly sales
from independent variables, such as

41
00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.899
customers, number of leads, and order history.

42
00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:28.839
Regression analysis can predict the price of
a house in an area based on its size, number

43
00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.660
of bedrooms, and so on.

44
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.520
You can use regression analysis to predict
when an automobile or an industrial machine

45
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.600
will require maintenance rather than waiting for it to fail.

46
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.320
You can even use it to predict employment
income from independent variables, such as

47
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.839
hours of work, education, occupation, sex, age,
years of experience, and so on.

48
00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:52.279
Indeed, you can find many examples of the
usefulness of regression analysis in these

49
00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:56.880
and many other fields or domains, such as
finance, healthcare, and retail.

50
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.360
Let's examine additional sample applications of regression.

51
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.080
You can use regression to estimate the rainfall
in a region based on meteorological factors,

52
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.039
such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,
and air pressure.

53
00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:13.240
It can also be used in the field of environmental
protection, for example, to determine the

54
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.860
probability and severity of wildfires.

55
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.460
In public health, you can use regression
analysis to predict the spread of infectious diseases.

56
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.860
You can even use it to estimate the likelihood
of developing diseases, such as diabetes,

57
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.419
heart disease, or cancer, based on patient data.

58
00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.639
There are many regression algorithms.

59
00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.899
Each algorithm is important in the appropriate
context and suited to specific conditions.

60
00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:40.580
Linear and polynomial regression are classical
statistical modeling methods, while random

61
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.779
forest and XGBoost are modern machine learning regression models.

62
00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:49.300
Other modern regression algorithms include
k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines,

63
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.979
and neural networks.

64
00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:55.820
In this video, you learned regression is a
machine-learning technique that models a relationship

65
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.820
between a continuous target variable and explanatory features.

66
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.139
Simple regression is when a single independent
variable estimates a dependent variable.

67
00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.020
This regression can be linear or nonlinear.

68
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.100
When more than one independent variable is present,
the process is called multiple regression.

69
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.179
There are many applications of regression.

70
00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:18.300
You can use it to forecast sales, predict
maintenance expenses, estimate rainfall,

71
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.940
and spread of infectious disease.
